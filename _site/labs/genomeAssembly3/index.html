    <h1 class="post-title">Genome Annotation</h1>
  </header>

  <div class="post-content">
    <p>Although assemblies are still in process, today is about annotating those genomes. We will use the MAKER pipeline to annotate our thrip genome with some homology-based and predictive evidence.</p>

<p>First, we will be doing some copying and uncompressing on the cluster that takes a little more bandwith than we should be using on the head node. Let’s get a processor on the compute node</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>srun --ntasks=1 --cpus-per-task=1 --mem-per-cpu=4gb --partition=common --account=bio790s-01-f21 --pty bash -i
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We are going to do a pretty bad job at annotation; we are not incorporating direct mRNA evidence, retraining the gene predictors, or retraining the TE models. Some details about this can be found on some other good online <a href="https://darencard.net/blog/2017-05-16-maker-genome-annotation/">tutorials</a>. Retraining models used to be a pretty annoying thing to do, but now additional tools like BUSCO have streamlined this.</p>

<p>Go ahead and copy today’s folder into your work directory</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>cd /work/YOUR_NETID/evolutionaryGenomics
cp -r hpc/group/bio790s-01-f21/evolutionaryGenomics/genomeAssembly3 .
cd genomeAssembly3
ls
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>***BUSCO
You will see two activities for today. First, we will run BUSCO on your previous assemblies to evaluate assembly quality. There is a quick user setup step needed though. Then we will start MAKER. BUSCO can be used in the future to evaluate your gene models too.</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>cd hpc/group/bio790s-01-f21/evolutionaryGenomics/programs/buscoV3.2b
python3 setup.py install --user
cd hpc/group/bio790s-01-f21/evolutionaryGenomics/genomeAssembly3/BUSCO
emacs runBusco.sh
#sbatch runBusco.sh
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>We are using an older version of BUSCO, version 3. This is because the newer versions are a real pain to install for everybody to use. BUSCOs are genes determined to span the root of certain phylogenetic group and conserved at least in observed species within that group. Running BUSCO in “genome” mode will use HMMs to find these conserved genes in the assembly. It should get underway and take about an hour to finish.</p>

<p>***MAKER
MAKER is executed through several control files. These are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>maker_exe.ctl - Where all of the program paths are supplied. Recall that MAKER is a wrapper around other gene prediction and alignment software.</li>
  <li>maker_bopts.ctl - Where all of the blast options are configured. These are generally fine to leave as default.</li>
  <li>maker_opts.ctl - Where the instructions for which evidence to use and how to reconcile them are configured. You will need to edit this file some.</li>
</ul>

<p>Let’s have a closer look at maker_opts.ctl</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>#-----Genome (these are always required)

<p>A few things, you will need to replace the fasta file in the assembly folder with your own. The Re-annotation section is for training the prediction software with hints. Normally, at least two rounds of annotation are done but we are overlooking that.</p>

<p>The EST Evidence section is where you would provide an assembled transcriptome. Ideally this comes from the target organism, but could be provided from a related species. Ir changes the expectations about sequence similarity. We provide some protein sequences in the next section though that will be blasted against the genome using tblastn.</p>

<p>We skipped over repeat masking. Masking occurs before the annotation, because it would be a waste of computing to blast against a lot of repetitive sequences. You can do the masking prior to annotation, but MAKER can wrap this into the pipeline for you. Training the repeat models can take some work though. Here, we assume the models based on fly are good enough, which is provided with the RepeatMasker software.</p>

<p>The Gene Prediction is where we decide which HMMs to use. Here, we specify Augustus only. We provide its canned fly models too. We also allow gene models to be based on the protein alignments. Here you can allow different types of data to be considered, and change what goes into the polishing steps.</p>

<p>We will discuss in more detail in class.</p>

<p>A note about MAKER. It is meant to be compiled with MPI and take advantage of many nodes and processors. Because of our limitations, we will not be using it with MPI. This can cause the annotation to take a while - plus the MPI libraries appear broken for them moment. For a serious project outside of this class, you will need to rebuild MAKER to make sure all of the libraries are linked correctly and use as many processors as you have available.</p>

<p>Here are a few steps to get is running - notice we make a temp directory again and you will need to specify this in the slurm script</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>cd ../MAKER
mkdir temp
emacs runMaker.sh
#sbatch runMaker.sh
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Once that is underway - maybe your BUSCO results are done? Have a look. You should have a short text file that summarizes the typical BUSCO categories.</p>

<p>Next week is moving on to population genomics. You will be doing more scripty things, since we will often iterate operations over chromosomes or genomic chunks. Pre-made sh scripts will no longer be provided either, so now will be a good chance to check that all of the basic UNIX operations (cp, ls, mkdir, etc.) and slurm directives are understood.</p>
