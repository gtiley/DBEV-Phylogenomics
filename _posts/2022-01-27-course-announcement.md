We are excited to start a new phylogenomics workshop, hosted by the Department of Biology and Plant Ecology (DBEV) at the University of Antananarivo. Workshop activities will take place over three days (6 March - 9 March), with exact times and location to be determined.<br>

Computers will be provided on-site for analyses and exercises; however, students may bring their own machines as they like. The workshop will be limited to 20 participants.<br>
